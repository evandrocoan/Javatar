release|master (develop)

## Javatar v2.0.0-prebeta.4
To install a prerelease version, please add `Javatar` to the `install_prereleases` list in the Package Control user's settings.

Prerelease version contains a new feature which will introduce in Javatar v2.0.0 but please keep in mind that prerelease version is not a stable build to use and not all features are fully working.

Please note that Javatar v1.0.0 settings **are not compatible** with Javatar v2.0.0 settings. Even though some settings remain the same.

For the development roadmap, please checkout `DevelopersNote.md` file in the `Developers` directory on the Javatar repository


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,

[1]: Auto-completion feature is a really great feature to have on Javatar. However, due to the development time and the feature scope of auto-complete, Javatar cannot implement the auto-completion within the expected time frame. To simplified the words, the auto-completion feature is cancelled.
